Useful scripts for RNA-seq analysis
- I just started uploading to GitHub and have years of scripts and pipelines. So stay tuned!
- All scripts are intended for analysis on a personal computer or AWS at low costs. They analyze one file at a time.
- They can be easily modified to process all files in parallel, but I did not add this option, as the syntax is completely dependent on the server's cluster management software, which are different from oneanother.
- You can also pick the ones you are interested in and pipe them into one process.
